# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **ai-job** (4149 symbols, 11052 relationships, 351 execution flows).

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze --index-only` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? Bootstrap with `npx`, `bunx`, or `pnpm dlx` — e.g. `bunx gitnexus@latest analyze` (npm 11 npx crash; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing.** Use `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs impact "symbolName" --direction upstream --repo .` (CLI fallback); report callers, processes, and risk. Never substitute grep for graph analysis.
- **MUST analyze graph changes before committing.** Use `detect_changes({scope: "all"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope all --repo .` (CLI fallback). `partial: true` or `truncated: true` is not a clean check — a zero means unseen, not unaffected; re-run it. For regression review: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "master"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope compare --base-ref "master" --repo .`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- **MUST treat `risk: UNKNOWN` as unresolved, not as low.** An empty caller set is not evidence the symbol is unused — it can also mean the callers are not resolvable by the index (plain-object property access, dynamic dispatch, cross-language calls). `impact` pairs `UNKNOWN` with a `riskNote` saying so. Confirm with a text search before treating the symbol as safe to change or delete; do not proceed on the strength of a zero.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method before MCP/CLI impact analysis.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis, and never read `UNKNOWN` as an all-clear — it means the walk could not answer, which is the one verdict that requires confirming by other means.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit before MCP/CLI graph change analysis.

# Release Workflow

- The user changed the release order on 2026-09-07: build, test, and verify locally first; then commit and push the tested source to GitHub for version management.
- Use build-job-helper.ps1 and release-job-helper.ps1 as the normal local workflow. GitHub checks validate the pushed archive; they are not a prerequisite for this local-first workflow.
- Keep one current local release and one previous rollback package. Always overwrite the existing job-helper-wxt-local-extension directory used by Chrome; do not create another active extension directory for each build.
- Record the exact source HEAD, dirty diff digest, version, build ID, Docker image IDs, and extension hashes in the receipt. Link the later Git commit to that tested build ID.
- Daily startup starts only the existing current containers. Database migration and extension-file publication belong to explicit release operations, with stopped writers, a verified database backup, and rollback protection.
- Browser-facing acceptance requires the installed extension's visible badge to match the receipt version/build ID. Without specific Chrome/BOSS authorization, update files and report that browser reload/badge verification remains manual.
- Never include unrelated dirty-worktree changes in a commit or push; isolate the requested change first.
